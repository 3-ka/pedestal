# Contributing to Pedestal

Wow, thanks for your interest in helping out with Pedestal. Let this document
serve as your guide.

### Looking for work?

If you're looking for a task to work on, check out the
[primed label](../../issues?labels=primed) in our issues.

Less defined tasks will be marked with the
[discuss label](../../issues?labels=discuss). Jump in here if you want to be
a part of something big.

### New Features

Pedestal is the thinking persons framework, so every contribution starts with
some *deeeep* thought. Finished?

Alright, your next step is to start a discussion.

Create an [issue](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new) to start
a conversation. Tell us what you're trying to accomplish and how you think you
might do it. If all is well, we'll probably give you the :thumbsup: to
start developing.

### Bugs

Of course, if you run into any straight-up bugs or weirdness feel free to skip
the thinking (or at least too much of it) and immediately submit an
[issue](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new).


We have an issue template in place that will ask you some details
about the platform you are running and how to reproduce the bug. (If
you can reproduce it reliably. If not, go ahead and file the issue
anyway so we can start looking at it.)

Some of the usual stuff we'll want to know:

* What happened?
    * "I manifested a being from the outer dimensions."
* What did you expect to happen?
    * "Hello, world."
* How can you reprodice it?
    * "I created a new Pedestal service with the template, then installed some code that Bob Howard gave me."
* What operating system and version are you using?
    * e.g. "OS X 10.8"
* What version of Clojure, Java, and Leiningen or Boot are you using?
    * e.g. "Leiningen 2.5.2 on Java 1.8.0_u40 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM"
* What Pedestal version are you using?
    * e.g. "0.5.0"
    * or, for a SNAPSHOT: "0.5.1-SNAPSHOT at d0cf2b4"

Even better, include a link to a gist or repository where we can jump straight
to the problem.

### Tests

We love well-tested code. All of our code is tested on [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal) and so too will any pull requests
you submit. It's super-cool and automatic!

But let's be serious, we won't accept pull requests unless they're either well
tested or sufficiently trivial (think docstring changes).

## Contributor's Agreement

When it comes to code contributions there is one more thing we need from
you: a signed contributor's agreement.

We know that a contributor's agreement can be a pain, but we want everyone
to be able to use Pedestal, including developers working on projects for very
large companies. Many of these big organizations care *a lot* about the provenance of
the code they use -- that is they need to know where the code came from and who owns it.
The contributor's agreement simply puts down in writing what we think is the
standard open source arrangement: Mostly it says that you are donating code that
you wrote to the project. By submitting a signed contributor's agreement,
you are helping to ensure that your work will be available to the largest possible audience.

It is an extra step, but there really is not much to executing the Pedestal contributor's agreement:
You just need to complete the following online agreement to assign copyright to Cognitect.
