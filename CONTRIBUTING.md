# Contributing to Pedestal

Wow, thanks for your interest in helping out with Pedestal. Let this document serve as your guide.

## Collaborative Hammock Time

Pedestal is the thinking persons framework, so every contribution starts with
some *deeeep* thought. Finished?

Alright, your next step is to start a discussion.

Create an [issue](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new) or email
[pedestal-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:pedestal-dev@googlegroups.com) to start
a conversation. Tell us what you're trying to accomplish and how you think you
might do it. If all is well, we'll probably give you the :thumbsup: to
start developing.

### Bugs

Of course, if you run into any straight-up bugs or weirdness feel free to skip
the thinking (or at least too much of it) and immediately submit an
[issue](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new).

At minimum include details about the platform you are running and steps to
reproduce--you know we're going to ask. Even better, include a link to a gist
or repository where we can jump straight to the problem.

### Tests

We love well-tested code. All of our code is tested on [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/pedestal/pedestal) and so too will any pull requests
you submit. It's super-cool and automatic!

But lets be serious, we won't accept pull requests unless they're either well
tested or sufficiently trivial (think docstring changes).

## Contributors Agreement

When it comes to code contributions there is but one more thing we need from
you: a signed contributors agreement.

_**Say wha!?**_ Yep, we don't like it much either,
but the fact of the matter is we use Pedestal on large projects for large
companies. These big orgs often care *a lot* about the *provenance* of
code--that is to say they **need** to know where code came from and who owns
it.

For this reason we must ask you submit a signed CA before we can accept any code submissions.

To submit a signed contributors agreement you merely need to submit a copy of the CA with
your signature (and a few other details) to [contribute@pedestal.io](mailto:contribute@pedestal.io).

[See here](http://pedestal.io/#contribute) to get your hands on the CA form and
find out more about the process.
