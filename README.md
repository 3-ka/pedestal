### Installing Libraries ###


Run `lein sub install` in the top level directory to install all the
library components in your local Maven repository.

The demo project uses Leiningen checkouts to allow simultaneous
development of libraries and the application. See the [Leiningen FAQ](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/FAQ.md)
for details.
